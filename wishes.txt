Happy Birthday to the one who means the world to me.

The one who thinks way too much, smiles like itâ€™s her job, and somehow manages to trip into drama without even trying! ðŸ˜„

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever find the perfect words to explain how much you mean to meâ€¦ but since itâ€™s your birthday and Iâ€™m feeling nice (just this once), Iâ€™ll give it a shot. ðŸ˜‰

...Thank you...

Thank you for being the sunshine with cheeks I constantly want to squish.
Thank you for showing up in my life and stayingâ€”for the laughter, the late-night talks, the silent understanding, and even the difficult conversations.
Thank you for being real with me, for seeing me when I felt invisible, and for reminding me that I matter, even on the days I forget.

Youâ€™ve been the calm in my storm (and sometimes the storm in my calm), my steady when everything else feels shaky.
Youâ€™ve taught me that love doesnâ€™t always come with fireworksâ€”it can also be quiet, patient, and steady. And thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™ve been for me.

Youâ€™re not just someone I care aboutâ€”youâ€™re the person who changed the way I see the world and myself.
Lifeâ€™s been way more interesting (and a lot louder) with you in it.

So today, I hope you feel just a fraction of the love you constantly give. You deserve that and so much more.
I hope this year brings you peace, joy, and everything youâ€™ve quietly wished for when no one was listening.

...Happy Birthday, you adorable emotional tornado...
Iâ€™m so lucky I get to say I know you.
And even luckier that we get to annoy each other foreverâ€”as only a sibling can.
